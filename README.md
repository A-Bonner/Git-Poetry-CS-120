# Git-Poetry-CS-120
This is a class exercise for CS 120 QR: Advanced Programming where students explore creating poetry using Git

The goal is to explore forking a repo, commiting a change to the forked files, and submitting a pull request to the main repo to accept that change back into the original repo so all the forks from the other students can then pull those changes into their fork
